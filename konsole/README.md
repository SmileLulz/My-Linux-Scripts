# Usage:

Note: If your Konsole windows already do open in new tabs instead of new windows, you should not use this script.

It just replaces how you open your KDE Konsole terminal.
It opens a new Konsole window in a new tab of in an already exsting window; instead of new window.

Make sure you have this option enabled: **Configure Konsole -> General -> Run all Konsole windows in a single process**
